# shuttle_express

A flutter app to book airplane tickets.

## Learning Curve
-- Building a bottom navigation bar using the default tool and also displaying data according to the selected navigation item. <br>
-- Adding spacer widget between widgets in Row or Column pushes the widgets to the far end of container. <br>
-- override your default styles with the .copyWith() method

## Useful packages
fluentui_icons: custom icons used in the bottom navigation bar <br>
gap: replaces SizedBox to automatically separate two widgets <br>
